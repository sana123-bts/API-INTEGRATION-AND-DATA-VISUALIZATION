I have chosen the "Requests" library as it is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Python, and I will choose the "Cat Facts API"  as it is a simple API that does not require authentication and provides interesting data that could potentially be visualized . I use this API to demonstrate the process of fetching data from an API. Then Converted the 'data' list to a pandas DataFrame, to inspect its structure and data types, check for missing values, and calculate the fact length.Then imported the necessary libraries for plotting and create a histogram and a box plot of the 'fact_length' column as requested in the instructions.Examined the generated histogram and box plot of cat fact lengths to interpret the visualizations and draw insights from the data.
